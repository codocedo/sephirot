Vertical Transmission of HIV-1" by J.P. Hughes and B.A. Richardson, JASA,

The attached file (breastdata.dat) contains 8 variables and 401 records. 
Variables are space delimited. All time variables are measured in months 
since birth. The variables are

hl - left endpoint of HIV-1 infection time interval.
     possible values: -1, 0 - 24, 25
                      -1 means in utero infection
                      0 - 24 means infection occurred no earlier than that
                             time.
                      25 means uninfected as of 24 months of age
hr - right endpoint of HIV-1 infection time interval.
     possible values: 0 - 24, 25
                      0 - 24 means infection occurred no later then that
                             time.
                      25 means uninfected as of 24 months of age
dtime - death time 
     possible values: 0 - 24; 25 
                      0 - 24 means infant died at that age
                      25 means infant was alive past 24 months of age
dstatus - status at dtime 
     possible values: 0 = alive, 1 = died
grp - randomization group
     possible values: 0 = formula, 1 = breastfeeding
test0 - was a test for HIV-1 infection done at birth?
     possible values: 1 = yes, 0 = no
result0 - if test0 = 1, result0 gives the result of the test
     possible values: 1 = positive, 0 = negative or no test done
confirm0 - was a positive test result at time 0 confirmed?
     possible values: 2 = test0=1 and result0=1 but no confirmation test done 
                      1 = test0=1 and result0=1 and confirmed positive
                      0 = else

Notes:
(1) If hl < 24 and hr = 25 then the infection status of the infant at
    death or end of followup is unknown. The infant last tested negative at
    hl and no additional tests are available before death or end of followup.
(2) Infants lost to followup or administratively censored at less than 24 
    months of age (due to end of the study) can be identified by dtime < 24 
    and dstatus = 0.
(3) When test0=1 and result0=1 and confirm0=2, then hr = 25 (i.e. infant may 
    have been uninfected in spite of positive test at birth)
(4) The variable "possfp" in the S-Plus programs combined() and weibspl()
    can be created by setting possfp = 1 if confirm0 >= 1, and 0 otherwise.
(5) Descriptive statistics for these data are given below.
